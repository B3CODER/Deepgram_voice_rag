They cover technical details like architecture, pricing, and how these systems handle semantic search and embeddings. For example, Weaviate is described as a cloud-native database written in Go that supports multiple vectors per object, while Typesense is highlighted for its speed and ability to auto-generate embeddings using models like OpenAI. There are also references to performance benchmarks and documentation for OpenSearch and the txtai framework.",
